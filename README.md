# Map documentation tool


This tool was built while also supporting network cabling teams around the country to give the team a way to easily document installations and stand up custom grafana panels. 

Essentially its a stamping tool a kin to something you would find in a drawing program like photoshop or gimp. It additionally records the x and y values and inserts them into a grafana specific json format for easy import.  

install instructions

```
// you can simply open the index.html file as a file:// 
// or you can host it by using something like 

$ npm i -g http-server 
// inside the project folder 

$ http-server .
